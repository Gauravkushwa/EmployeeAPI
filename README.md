Project: Employee Management API
What is this project about?
This project is a web API that helps you manage employee data. You can use it to:

Add new employees.

View all employees or a single employee by their ID.

Update employee details (e.g., name, email, salary).

Delete employees.

All the employee data is stored in a SQL Server database.

How does it work?
The project is divided into small parts, each with a specific job:

Employee Model: Defines what an employee looks like (e.g., name, email, salary).

Database Context: Connects the API to the database.

Employee Service: Handles all the logic for adding, updating, deleting, and fetching employees.

Employee Controller: Provides the API endpoints (URLs) to interact with the system.

Dependency Injection: Ensures all parts of the project work together smoothly.

What are the main files?
Here’s a breakdown of the important files in the project:

1. Models/Employee.cs
This file defines the Employee class, which represents an employee in the system.

It includes fields like:

Id: A unique number for each employee.

FirstName: The employee's first name.

LastName: The employee's last name.

Email: The employee's email address.

DateOfBirth: The employee's date of birth.

Position: The employee's job position.

Salary: The employee's salary.

2. Data/AppDbContext.cs
This file connects the API to the SQL Server database.

It tells the system to create an Employees table in the database to store employee data.

3. Services/EmployeeService.cs
This file contains all the business logic for managing employees.

It handles tasks like:

Fetching all employees.

Fetching a single employee by ID.

Adding a new employee.

Updating an employee's details.

Deleting an employee.

4. Controllers/EmployeeController.cs
This file provides the API endpoints (URLs) that you can use to interact with the system.

For example:

GET /api/employees: Fetches all employees.

GET /api/employees/{id}: Fetches a single employee by ID.

POST /api/employees: Adds a new employee.

PUT /api/employees/{id}: Updates an employee's details.

DELETE /api/employees/{id}: Deletes an employee.

5. appsettings.json
This file stores the database connection string, which tells the API how to connect to the SQL Server database.

6. Program.cs
This file configures and starts the API.

It sets up things like:

Database connection.

Dependency injection (to connect all parts of the project).

Swagger (a tool to test the API easily).

7. Migrations/ Folder
This folder is auto-generated by Entity Framework Core.

It contains the instructions for creating and updating the database schema.

How to use the API?
Once the API is running, you can use tools like Postman or Swagger to interact with it. Here’s what you can do:

Add a new employee:

Send a POST request to /api/employees with the employee's details (e.g., name, email, salary).

View all employees:

Send a GET request to /api/employees.

View a single employee:

Send a GET request to /api/employees/{id} (replace {id} with the employee's ID).

Update an employee:

Send a PUT request to /api/employees/{id} with the updated details.

Delete an employee:

Send a DELETE request to /api/employees/{id}.

Why is this project useful?
This project is a great starting point for building real-world applications. It demonstrates:

How to create a web API.

How to connect to a database.

How to organize code using best practices like dependency injection and separation of concerns.

How to extend this project?
If you want to add more features, you can:

Add authentication to secure the API.

Add validation to ensure only valid data is saved.

Add logging to track important events.

Deploy the API to a cloud platform like Azure or AWS.
